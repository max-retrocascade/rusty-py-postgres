# rusty-py-postgres
Codespace, Dev-container, Docker setup for an environment including Rust, Python and Postgres.

Created as an interation of the Rust-Postgres dev-container template (https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/rust-postgres)

Acts as a starting point for developing solutions which include the three languages. This is my first public repositiory, so if there are any improvements to be made I am all ears.
